# Job-Application-Autofill-Automation
Autofills and Automates filling out Job Apllications using Xpaths and python.

##Description

I was looking for a python program that would allow me easy quick change from career site to career site for automation. There wasnt
one that did what I exactly wanted. This program Opens a new browser window but will keep it open and only work inside that particular session
you can navigate around yourself and selenium and the chrome driver will stay connected to that session that opened instead of opening a new one.
This allows you to navigate a Career website live to different job applications and (run the last cell - input cell) and watch it fill out the app.
The only thing you really need to do is go through and grab the xpaths of all the cells on the path and change the keys depending on what the cell is
drop down or key input.
